I needed a quick answer, solved the equations and thought that it 
would be a waste of energy to recalculate it ever again.
Don't know whether it is of specific use for anyone.

So... I invested more time and wrote a python script. 
 - because python is cool.
 - because the bias of lost investments doesn't apply if work with something cool
 - and likewise `you ain't gonna need it` doesn't apply either.
