### the case
I needed a quick answer, solved the equations and thought that it 
would be a waste of energy to recalculate it ever again.

So... I invested more time and wrote a python script. 
 - because python is cool.
 - because the sunk cost bias doesn't apply if work with something cool
 - and likewise `you ain't gonna need it` doesn't apply either.

### usage
Don't know whether it is of specific use for anyone other than a
developer playground.

### units
Units were checked on paper. Looking to insert units in the code.
So far I checked:
 - `units` didn't cancel the units correctly, though it could also be my mistake
   to not define units which the package cancels correctly
 - `pint` not suitable for mols, not giving up on it completely

> If you have an idea regarding this I'm happy to liston to / read your idea!
