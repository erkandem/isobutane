I needed a quick answer, solved the equations and thought that it 
would be a waste of energy to recalculate it ever again.

So... I invested more time and wrote a python script. 
 - because python is cool.
 - because the sunk cost bias doesn't apply if work with something cool
 - and likewise `you ain't gonna need it` doesn't apply either.

Don't know whether it is of specific use for anyone.
